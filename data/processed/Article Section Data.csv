0,2020-07-20,0,"The European Commission has fined US-based Celanese, Switzerland's Clariant, and Mexico's Orbia a total of $296 million for colluding to purchase ethylene at the lowest possible price in Europe. US-based Westlake Chemical also participated in the cartel, but they told on themselves and evaded all penalties by doing so. The four companies coordinated their price negotiation strategies so that ethylene sellers would agree to sell ethylene at a lower price. Ethylene is most commonly produced by steam cracking natural gas and is mostly used to produce polyethylene. This isn't the kind of collusion you're more familiar with—when sellers agree to set prices higher than they otherwise would be. Colluding to purchase ethylene at a lower price hurts ethylene sellers and increases the profits of the ethylene purchasers.Read the press release here.",6,849,0,1.0
1,2020-07-20,1,"Poland's state-controlled largest refiner, PKN Orlen, is making acquisitions to become an energy giant capable of competing in international oil and gas markets. PKN Orlen bought 80% of Poland's state power company, Energa, earlier this year. They purchased a smaller Polish refiner, Lotos, just last week. And now, they have signed a letter of intent to acquire Poland's natural gas company PGNiG. It's not that you'll ever work for this Polish oil & gas company, it's just important to understand how it stacks up to companies you know. In this case, once PKN Orlen completes all of these acquisitions it would be capable of generating annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $5 billion. For some perspective, Valero did $6 billion in 2019, and Phillips 66 did $4 billion.Read more here.",5,832,0,0.0

This means that the proteins produced are identical to those produced by cows, and can be used as a drop-in substitute for any product that uses cow milk. Perfect Day isn't the only company using fermentation as a pathway to identical end products. San Diego's Genomatica has already commercialized processes to produce 1,4-Butanediol (for the plastics industry) and butylene glycol (for the cosmetics industry). The chemicals Genomatica is producing have only been possible with oil derivatives until now. Obviously scaling fermentation bioprocesses globally is no easy feat, but it's at least something to look out for.Read more about Perfect Day here or Genomatica here.",4,852,0,2.0
3,2020-07-21,0,"Standard Oil successor, Chevron, announced yesterday that they will be acquiring Houston-based Noble Energy for $5 billion in stock. All that shale in Colorado and the Permian Basin increases Chevron's proven oil and gas reserves by 18%. Just one year ago Chevron was outbid by Occidental when trying to acquire Anadarko. Anadarko at the time had roughly 1.473 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in proven reserves and Occidental ended up paying $38 billion. Chevron just bought Noble Energy's 2.05 BOE for $5 billion. Chevron was one of the first oil majors to cut spending when the price of oil crashed earlier this year. The oil price crash reduced the share value of many energy companies, making them look like snacks for companies with enough resources. Chevron was sitting on $8.5 billion in cash at the end of Q1 2020.Read more here.",8,846,1,10.0

A water sachet is a bag of water, known for being the most affordable method of providing clean drinking water to Nigeria's citizens. Dow hopes to divert around 300 million sachets from ending up in a landfill or the environment. Nigerian waste management start-up, RecyclePoints, will be collecting the used water sachets and delivering them to Dow's facility. They hope to create a long term infrastructure for plastic recycling. Dow produces the plastic that goes into these bags.

6,2020-07-22,0,"Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas,  ExxonMobil, Georgia Tech, and Imperial College London have published joint research on a refining membrane. The research successfully demonstrated that the primary components of gasoline (naptha) and jet fuel (kerosene) could be separated through a membrane by pressure instead of by heat (like in a distillation column). A similar process for water purification, reverse osmosis, reduces the energy requirement for desalination ten times over. Plenty of research and development is required to progress the membrane technology to an industrial scale. But eventually, the membranes could potentially replace some steps in the refining process and contribute to a hybrid-refining system. Since the year 2000, Exxon has invested roughly $10 billion in projects dedicated to develop lower-emission energy solutions. New technologies don't come out of nowhere; they take a lot of money and a lot of time.Read the press release here.",7,968,2,1.0

8,2020-07-22,2,"A potential agreement between Iran and China, obtained by The New York Times, describes plans for China to invest $280 billion in Iran's oil & gas industry. The document hasn't been officially announced from either country, but it's implications are worth exploring. Good luck reading it! There have been talks of a potential agreement for years. In 2016, the two countries signed a letter of intent to establish a partnership, but no official agreement ever surfaced. If an agreement is ever reached, this would lead to large scale investments from China in Iran's oil and gas reserves. In recent years, Iran hasn't seen much investment in those resources due to economic sanctions. If China invests in Iran, they might receive a heavily discounted supply of petrochemicals from them. In a drastic oversimplification, if China is getting a good deal from Iran they may have less reason to buy from US producers. Politics plays a role in the petrochemical industry, so even though this is just a rumor, it's a solid reminder of what's possible.Read more here from ICIS.",5,1069,2,33.0

10,2020-07-23,1,"German specialty chemicals company, Evonik, has announced the opening of a new technology center for 3D printing in Austin, Texas. The site will develop new materials to be manufactured by their novel Structured Polymers technology. The 3D printing industry is expected to grow an average of 24% annually through 2024. Back in 2019, Evonik acquired Austin-based startup Structured Polymers Inc. Structured Polymers' technology produces polymer powders that are then unified by selective laser sintering (SLS). What makes their technology unique is its ability to produce the powders from a wide range of polymers. Evonik is already the leading manufacturer of polyamide (PA) 12 powders, so the acquisition means they can expand into other materials. PA 12 is made from the precursor laurolactam, laurolactam is made from cyclododecatriene (CDT), CDT is made by cyclotrimerization of butadiene, 95% of the world's butadiene comes from the steam cracking of ethane, and that ethane comes out of oil & gas reserves.Read the press release here.",7,1040,3,1.0

A subsidiary of Taiwan's Grand Pacific Petrochemical Corporation (GPPC) will operate the new 450,000 metric ton per year facility. LyondellBasell is the world's largest licensor of PP technology. Initially introduced in 1982, the Spheripol process technology now accounts for roughly 35% of the world's PP capacity. You can read more about the technology and it's history here. By licensing their technology LyondellBasell earns royalties, ensures that they can sell their catalyst, and introduces more of the very own Spheripol PP that they produce to the market. Increasing Spheripol's market share can benefit LyondellBasell because it means more customers downstream are already accustomed to using it. Hypothetically, that would make it easier for LyondellBasell to sell their PP.Read the press release here.",4,989,3,1.0
12,2020-07-24,0,"Leaders of the European Union have agreed on a $0.93 per kilogram tax on non-recycled plastic waste as part of their $857 billion COVID-19 recovery package. That's roughly equivalent to a one-cent tax per 16oz water bottle. Initially proposed back in 2018, the tax will be introduced on January 1st, 2021, and will begin generating revenues for the EU's budget. The revenues are not earmarked to support a recycling infrastructure, despite concerns from industry. While European companies are generally supportive of a plastic waste tax, they want to see the money generated go towards sustainability. European leader in chemical recycling, Plastic Energy, warns that the ""tax will only have a positive impact on the sustainability goals if the revenue is directed towards recycling infrastructure, investment, and innovation in the field."".Read more here on ICIS.",4,864,4,1.0
13,2020-07-24,1,"Industrial gases company, Air Liquide, has announced an investment of $142 million to construct a combined Air Separation Unit (ASU) with a built-in energy storage system in the Netherlands. Storing energy is an important aspect of renewable energy development because the wind isn't always blowing and the sun isn't always shining. ASUs separate oxygen, nitrogen, and argon from air by cooling the air down (we're talking -221°F) until it liquefies. You can then pass the liquid air through a distillation column to separate the components. Or, you could store that liquid air, and later expand it back into a gas to power a turbine. While Air Liquide hasn't specified exactly what they will be doing, it seems likely that they will be utilizing this cryogenic energy storage system. It's extremely costly to build a cryogenic air storage system (see Highview Power) for the sole purpose of energy storage. But the marginal cost of adding storage and energy production capability to a new (or already existing?) ASU? That could be feasible.Read the press release here.",4,1069,4,10.0

The new plant will be built to its existing facility in Hsinshu, and will increase its production capacity by 50%. As Michael McCoy from C&EN put it, ""After every application of an exotic material to a silicon wafer, a meticulous cleaning step is needed to remove leftover particles and other unwanted gunk. While new chip fabrication materials get the headlines, ultra-high-purity cleaning chemicals are unsung heroes making them possible."". Semiconductor manufacturing is a complicated and long process, but it enables all of the technology we use today. MCC's cleaning chemicals plant will produce a high purity solution to remove particles and impurities that would destroy the functionality of the chips. Demand for computer chips is showing no signs of slowing down. As nations become more developed everything we own tends to become more connected, and so long as that is true more of these chemicals will need to be manufactured. Recently, growth in the industry has been associated with the need to produce chips that will enable 5G technology.Read more here on Nikkei Asian Review.",5,1239,3,20.0

The ISCC has certified that SABIC's Trucircle line of polymers meets those standards. Now, SABIC can offer its customers the ability to reach their sustainability goals and increase their brand value. The certification uses a mass balance approach—meaning that for each ton of renewable/circular feedstock fed into the process, one ton of the output materials can be classified as renewable/circular. So, while the actual plastic used to bag the carrots could be 99% fossil-fuel-based, SABIC can only sell as much renewable/circular plastic as they source sustainably.Read the press release here.",8,939,0,12.0

247,2020-11-11,1,"Chemical manufacturing subsidiary of Saudi Aramco, SABIC, has announced that its certified circular polypropylene (PP) will be used in pet food packaging by Mars. First, SABIC takes some renewable/circular feedstock and adds it to its typical PP production process (we saw this same thing 2 weeks ago). For every ton of renewable/circular feedstock used, SABIC can sell one ton of ""certified circular"" PP. Those PP pellets are sent off to Huhtamaki to be converted into packaging for Mars. Mars will then take that packaging, toss some pet food into it, and the rest is history. Mars hopes to reduce its use of virgin plastics by 25% and to increase its average recycled plastic content to 30% by 2025. To do that, Mars has to demand it from its suppliers, and its suppliers have to demand it from its suppliers. So while you may see Mars' tiny logo on the back of your pet's bag of food, don't forget that the chemical company making the material is who made the green packaging possible.Read the press release here.",7,1017,2,7.0

Santoprene, which is a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), was developed (and trademarked) by Monsanto in the late 1970s. If you want to get fancy with it, this TPE is a vulcanized ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber encased in a polypropylene matrix. Exxon got its hands on the technology in a roundabout way that ended with an acquisition in 2002. Celanese has had excess cash since it sold its stake in Polyplastics about a year ago, and Exxon is looking to improve its profit (and reduce its debt burden) by selling its lower-margin operations.

Next, three parts hydrogen and one part nitrogen are combined in the Haber-Bosch process to produce 183,000 tons per year of ammonia. The project, which is still subject to a feasibility study, is expected to start construction sometime next year. In Monday's newsletter, we talked about Chevron and Cummins making an effort to promote hydrogen's usage as an energy carrier—which is controversial. It's important that you recognize this green ammonia project as an entirely different beast. In this case, hydrogen is a chemical feedstock for ammonia, which is primarily used to make fertilizers. People aren't arguing (well, not nearly as many) about whether we should decarbonize the production of fertilizers.Read the press release here.",6,1011,2,82.0
760,2021-07-21,1,"US chemical company, DuPont, and its spin-offs, Chemours and Corteva, have agreed to pay Delaware $50 million in compensation for leaking polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) into groundwater. Historically, DuPont used perfluorooctanoic acid (a PFAS) as a processing aid in the manufacturing of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon). This alone isn't inherently a poor decision—the regrettable decision is the one that allowed the PFAS to leak into the environment. We now know that PFAS are proven to have adverse effects on human health. The issue heated up when this NY Times article dropped in 2016 and the movie Dark Waters premiered in 2019. Now, DuPont and its spin-offs share liabilities for the pollution issues. Back in January, the companies agreed to share $4 billion in expected costs for the next 20 years. This agreement with the state of Delaware is one of many settlements expected in the future. In this case, the $50 million will be held in a trust fund and be spent working towards ""environmental restoration, improvement, sampling and analysis, community environmental justice and equity grants, and other natural resource needs."".Read more here on Delaware Business Times.",14,1192,2,74.0

Last December, SK Group led a $17 million Series B funding round for Group14. The South Korean conglomerate wants to bring Group14's technology back home to serve South Korea's rapidly expanding battery industry. Group14 is on board because the country is home to many of its potential customers, and establishing global production makes the company more resilient to supply chain shocks.

CE is using direct air capture to pull CO2 from the atmosphere. That CO2 will be utilized by LanzaTech to produce ethanol (thanks to some biotechnology—details here). Then, LanzaJet (a LanzaTech spin-off), will dehydrate that ethanol and combine the remaining hydrocarbons into chains via this proprietary process to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Currently, blending SAF with traditional kerosene is the only viable method of reducing emissions associated with aviation. That's why both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are partners (aka investors) on the project.

We've been making indigo dye (aka indigotin) via chemical processes since the end of the 19th century. The process was perfected by BASF in 1925 when the company figured out how to make this intermediate by reacting aniline with formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. Today, indigo dye is used almost exclusively to dye the 5 billion pairs of blue jeans that are produced each year. For context, each pair of jeans uses about 10 grams of dye, so roughly 50,000 tons of dye is used per year. Huue and Ginko are going to develop a microbe that can economically produce the same dye BASF made its name with (the ""A"" stands for aniline). Ginko is known for accelerating this development (they see themselves as Amazon AWS for biotech companies). But while it's true that these companies are tackling an issue, it's important to remember how tiny 50,000 tons per year is to large chemical companies. For example, the chemical industry pumps out some 200 million tons of ethylene each year (that's 4000x more). The incumbents (like BASF) have bigger sustainability issues to worry about than making dye more sustainable.Read the press release here.",11,1293,0,103.0

About half of the world's VCM is made by thermally cracking EDC (which is made by the direct chlorination of ethylene), and the other half is made by reacting acetylene with hydrogen chloride. The acetylene half of production is done almost entirely in China thanks to the region's vast coal and lime resources that make acetylene relatively cheap.The main producers of VCM are the same ones who make PVC—think of Westlake Chemical, OxyChem, Shintech, and Formosa.",13,1031,2,29.0

Solugen has figured out how to produce enzymes (via CRISPR modified yeast cells) that cost 0.1-1% of the typical price per kilogram. The company then uses those enzymes as catalysts to synthesize molecules chemoenzymatically. These biobased catalysts allow Solugen to produce products (like their water treatment chemicals) from sugar (dextrose) with a carbon-negative footprint. Another low-carbon molecule-producing solution, fermentation, uses microorganisms to produce molecules. But when those microorganisms convert sugar into alcohol they also produce CO2 (reducing the percent of carbon feedstock utilized in the process).Solugen's enzyme doesn't need to sit inside a microorganism, which increases the carbon utilization of the process. With the extra cash, and the holy grail of carbon-negativity, the company is going to go on a hiring spree and expand into plastic monomers, resins, surfactants, and more.Read the press release here.",7,1055,4,107.0

But mattresses don't last forever, so companies like BASF and Covestro have been developing ways to recover polyols from that PU. Dow and four other companies (who have other roles in the supply chain) have created a system to collect, dismantle, depolymerize foam mattresses, and recover the polyols (which will be marketed as Renuva). The plant is capable of processing 200,000 foam mattresses per year. That's obviously a lot of mattresses—but it pales in comparison to the 18 million thrown away each year by the US alone.

Since then, PVDC's main use has been in meat packaging because of the polymer's excellent barrier properties. While still critical today, alternatives to PVDC are arising as companies ban the polymer because of the problem it presents for recycling. One reason why recycling plastic is so complicated is because of the large number of different polymers out there. Sorting those materials is a pain. So mechanical recyclers do their best to sift out problem children (like PVDC) and molecular recyclers try to minimize contaminants (like the chlorine produced when depolymerizing a polymer like PVDC).

Cumene was just a component of aviation fuel during WWII (crude oil is about 1% wt cumene) before it got its big break in the early 1950s. Shortly after WWII, Hercules Powder figured out how the molecule can be used to produce phenol, making it an attractive molecule for petroleum companies to produce.As it was done back then, most of cumene produced today is done by the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene with propylene. That process spits out some 16 million tons per year of cumene. Nearly all of it, about 98%, is used to make phenol and acetone and the rest is used in high-octane aviation fuel or as a paint thinner.Some of the main companies pumping out all the cumene are BASF, Dow Chemical, Tata Chemicals, Ineos, and ExxonMobil.",12,847,0,30.0
